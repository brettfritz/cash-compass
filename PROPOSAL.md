# Cash Compass
## Pointing you towards financial freedom

## Project Summary
We want to make a personal finance/net worth tracker that would be accessable to anyone. A person would be able to go to the website and create an account with their personal information. Once logged in, they will have access to all of their personal financial information, their budget, their spending, their saving, thier investing. They will be able to pull any transactions that they have logged in order to get specific information and perform analysis. They will be able to add new transactions for anything in their day to day life, a fast food meal they just bought, money they sent to a savings account, a student loan payment. Each of these transactions will be added to the database associated with their login id.

The user will also be able to input thier personal financial vairables in order to calculate their take home pay and an accurate baseline for their budget. These inputs would include some of the following: salary/hourly rate, hours worked per week, marital status, dependants, benefits, etc. The app can recommend adding additional income/hours worked, based on spending trends and habits.

Additionally, there will be a "predictive purchase" feature where the user can explore a future purchase. They will be able to input the cost of the product they are looking to purchase and see how it will fit into their budget, without making the purchase yet. If the product has multiple/reoccuring costs the user will be able to see all costs associated with the purchase, and plan for all aspects of the purchase.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

We aim to create a personal finance and net worth tracker accessible to everyone, allowing users to create an account, log in, and manage their financial information, including budgets, spending, savings. Users can add and analyze transactions, which will be securely stored in a database associated with their account.

## Stretch Goals

Eventually we would like to impliment an investment side to the app. A place where users can track their portfolios, savings accounts, assets, and net worth. We would like to impliment a dashboard where the user can see an up to date representation of where all of their money is, where it goes, and what it's doing. Parts of this would include implimenting a third party APIs for stock price tracking for accurate and up to date portfolio value and performance, tracking biggest movers and trending topics/stocks, and keeping up to date with financial news. We would also like to impliment an area for educational resources and financial learning.
